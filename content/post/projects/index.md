### Formula SAE
Most of my time is spent coding for MIT's Formula SAE Electric Vehicle team. Every year, we build a Formula 1 style electric vehicle racecar, and compete in the Formula Hybrid and Formula SAE competitions. 

As software lead, I'm responsible for managing my subteam and delivering vehicle controls, board firmware, and data acquisition subsystems. 

My work can be found here:

### FPGA Sheet Music Transcriber
Other Projects I've done include building an FPGA Sheet music transcriber for MIT's 6.205 Digital Systems Lab. This system has a microphone that converts piano audio data into sheet music!

### KUKA IIWA Typing Robot in Drake
For MIT's 6.4210 Robotic Manipulation class, we created a typing KUKA IIWA arm with an Allegro hand that is able to type messages on a QWERTY style keyboard using multiple fingers. We used pydrake and meshcat for our simulation.
