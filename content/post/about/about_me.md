Hi there! I'm Monica Chan, a senior studying EECS at MIT. 
My interests include embedded systems, software design and integration, digital design, and AI. 

I am on track to graduate with my Bachelor's in EECS from MIT in 2025, and a Master's in EECS from MIT in 2026. 

Iâ€™ve worked at Renesas Electronics, Tesla, SpaceX, and I will be working at Palantir in Summer of 2025. At Renesas I was responsible for delivering a lossy inductor model for simulation in Simplis. At Tesla, I developed the Service UI Charging Panel for Cybertruck, created fleet analysis tools for Service Engineering, and contributed to Service Engineering for Cybertruck launch. At SpaceX, I was on the ground segment telemetry team for Falcon, providing automation tools for operators on console and installing weather stations in Cape Canaveral. At Palantir, I will be a Forward Deployed Software Intern in the NYC office.
