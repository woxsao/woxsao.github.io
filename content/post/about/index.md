Hi there! I'm Monica Chan, a junior studying EECS at MIT. 
My interests include embedded systems, software design and integration, digital design, and AI. 

I am on track to graduate with my Bachelor's in EECS from MIT in 2025, and a Master's in EECS from MIT in 2026. 

You can email me at mochan@mit.edu.
