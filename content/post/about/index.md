Hi there! I'm Monica Chan, a junior studying EECS at MIT. 
My interests include embedded systems, software design and integration, digital design, and AI. 

I am on track to graduate with my Bachelor's in EECS from MIT in 2025, and a Master's in EECS from MIT in 2026. 

Iâ€™ve worked at Renesas Electronics, Tesla, and will be working at SpaceX in 2024. At Renesas I was responsible for delivering a lossy inductor model for simulation in Simplis. At Tesla, I developed the Service UI Charging Panel for Cybertruck, created fleet analysis tools for Service Engineering, and contributed to Service Engineering for Cybertruck launch. At SpaceX, I will be on the ground segment telemetry team for Falcon.

You can email me at mochan@mit.edu.
